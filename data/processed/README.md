## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:
For each household, we collected: 
- one liter sample from the storage reservoir (e.g. rainwater cistern or tank) and 
- one liter sample from the point of consumption for direct ingestion (e.g. drinking bottle or household filter).
Our aim was to compare water quality at these two points and to identify potential problems in household water-handling practices.

2.  Methods for processing the data:
Typical mean calculations.
3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the
    data: 
Not applicable.
4.  Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: -
water samples for human consumption were collected and their physical-chemical analysis was performed, according to procedures established by APHA/AWWA/WEF (2012): American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, & Water Environment Federation. (2012). Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater (22nd ed.). American Public Health Association.

5.  Environmental/experimental conditions:
