	abstract = {Objective
To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of Giardia infection among rural communities among rural communities in Yemen.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 605 stool samples were collected and screened for the presence of Giardia duodenalis (G. duodenalis) cysts and/or trophozoites by using three different diagnostic methods: direct smear, formalin-ether sedimentation, and trichrome staining. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information on the demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and environmental characteristics of the participants.
Results
Overall, 28.1\% (170/605) of the participants were infected by G. duodenalis. The prevalence was significantly higher among male participants compared to female (P = 0.034); however, it was not significant among different age groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified four variables as the significant key risk factors of Giardia infection among the sampled communities. These are, in addition to being of the male gender, using unsafe water sources for drinking water, not washing hands after defecation, presence of other family members infected with Giardia, and close contact with domestic animals.
Conclusions
The study reveals that Giardia infection is still prevalent among rural communities in Yemen. The provision of clean and safe drinking water, proper sanitation, and health education regarding personal hygiene practices, particularly handwashing, as well as identifying and treating infected family members is imperative and these interventions should be considered in a strategy to control intestinal parasites among these communities in order to curtail the transmission and morbidity caused by G. duodenalis.},

	abstract = {Water Safety Plans (WSPs) are a comprehensive risk assessment and management approach to water delivery that were internationally recommended in 2004. WSPs consist of five implementation steps, followed by evaluation. To date, approximately 90 countries have implemented WSPs; however widespread uptake is limited by lack of documented outcomes and impacts. We conducted a systematic review to collate outcomes, impacts, and lessons learned from WSPs developed in general, rural, and three case-study country contexts. Overall, 53 documents met inclusion criteria. In general contexts, the need for institutional support during WSP implementation was highlighted. In rural applications, the need to simplify the WSP process and provide community support was emphasized. In case-study countries, we found the WSP process was selectively adapted and integrated within existing programs. In outcome and impact evaluations, financial outcomes have the clearest evidence base, while operational outcomes are documented most frequently, particularly in relation to infrastructure improvements. However, evidence is lacking on institutional and policy outcomes and impacts of WSPs. To ensure WSPs reach their potential for improving water delivery and management, support should be provided to implementers, outcomes and impacts of urban, peri-urban, and rural WSP implementations should be evaluated, and adaptation of WSPs locally encouraged.},

	abstract = {Access to safe drinking water is particularly challenging in rural areas due to inadequate purification technologies, operational limitations, and contamination from agricultural activities. This requires the implementation of risk assessment methodologies for drinking water supply systems, such as Water Safety Plans (WSP), as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Boyacá, a department in Colombia's Andean region, is known as the country's agricultural hub. However, more than 80 \% of the rural aqueducts in this region provide water that is unsafe for human consumption, with quality control limited to periodic monitoring by health authorities. This study implemented phases two and three of the WSP, focussing on the identification of hazards and risk assessment, in rural communities of Boyacá. Also identified 16 hazardous events: 8 in the catchment area, 6 in treatment processes, and 2 in the distribution system. The catchment area posed the highest risk, with 36 \% of hazards classified as very high risk due to direct and indirect discharges from agriculture and livestock. As the first of its kind in Boyacá, this study involved active participation of local communities and stakeholders. Addressing these risks has the potential to improve the quality of water for more than 2000 people in the region.},
